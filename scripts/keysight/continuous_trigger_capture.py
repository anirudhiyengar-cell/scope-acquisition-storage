CONTINUOUS TRIGGER CAPTURE AUTOMATION FOR OSCILLOSCOPE
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
--------
This program automates the process of capturing screenshots and data from a
Keysight oscilloscope every time a trigger event occurs. Think of it as a
camera that takes a picture and records measurements each time an electrical
signal crosses a specific threshold.

WHAT IT DOES (In Simple Terms):
--------------------------------
1. Connects to an oscilloscope (a device that displays electrical signals)
2. Waits for a signal to cross a specified level (called a "trigger")
3. When triggered, it:
   - Takes a screenshot of the oscilloscope display
   - Saves the actual data values to a CSV file
   - Records measurements (voltage, frequency, etc.)
4. Repeats this process for as many captures as you specify
5. Provides a web-based interface so you can control everything from your browser

TYPICAL USE CASE:
-----------------
Testing electronics where you need to capture many events automatically,
such as monitoring power-on sequences, signal quality over time, or
intermittent faults.
